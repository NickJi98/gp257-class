    "Slurm is a workload manager. Its jobs is to efficiently and fairly provide cluster resources. A slurm controlled cluster is ususally broken up into parittions where different sets of rules on use and are often composed of different hardware.  You use slurm resources by making a request to the slurm controller node for resources.  Your request is evaluated for priority based on what are referred to as \"fairshare\" rules. When there are free resources and you have the top priority you are granted access."

    "\n",
    "Clusters are always trying to maximize there usage.  As a result they often have a mechanism that allows unused resources used for free at or a reduced cost. In general you get to use these resources until someone who has/or is willing to pay/has paid a higher cost. At Stanford, the Sherlock clusters owner's queue operates in this manner. If you submit a job to the queue it will use all free resources if the owner of the resource requests those resources your job will be killed. GCP has the concept of preemitible nodes, which opperate at a much lower cost, but the jobs can be killed at any time.\n",

    "Many applications can take advantage of these potentially killed resources.  They are ideal for jobs that take a short time and don't use many cores.
