    "For **question 1**: In terms of Python data type, \"there is no limit for the length of integer literals apart from what can be stored in available memory\". In other words, no overflow happens for Python variable in the example, given sufficiently large memory available. However, for Numpy variable in the array, since we designate its data type to be `np.int32` or `np.int64`, overflow happens.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For **question 2**: If no negative values are involved, we can use unsigned integer type. For same bits of integer representation, the upper limit is doubled.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For **question 3**: I use four example cases to understand the mechanism.\n",
    "* Example 1: Numpy <span style=\"color:red\"> variable </span> with `+=` operator, number 1 as default integer type (Instruction case).\n",
    "* Example 2: Numpy <span style=\"color:red\"> variable </span> with `+=` operator, number 1 as integer type `np.int32`. This case gives the overflow warning.\n",
    "* Example 3: Numpy <span style=\"color:red\"> variable </span> with `+=` operator, number 1 as float type `np.float32`.\n",
    "* Example 4: Numpy <span style=\"color:blue\"> array </span> with `+=` operator, array `np.array([1])` as float type `np.float32`. This case gives the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error provides the hint. The first critical point is the accuracy of addition operator `+`. The result of operation accommodates the input data types. For Example 1, `int32 + int64` &rarr; `int64`. For Example 3 and 4, `int + float` &rarr; `float`. If the input data types are the same, the output one will also be this data type, as shown by Example 2 with the overflow warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second critical point is related to the addition assignment operator `+=`. Example 1-3 indicate that Numpy <span style=\"color:red\"> variable </span> can be flexible. However, the error in Example 4 indicates that Numpy <span style=\"color:blue\"> array </span> has fixed data type. The assignment operation of the `+=` operator will perforce convert the operation results into the original data type. Thus, in the first question we see that adding 1 to the Numpy array causes overflow, and in Example 4 there arises an error."

    "Before starting this exercise, please read the [Round-off Errors](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter09.03-Roundoff-Errors.html) section in Chapter 9 of *Python Numerical Methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, were are going to examine [Truncation](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2003/pests/2002/lectures/07.1_FloatingPoint/truncation.htm?CurrentSlide=6) errors, which are related to Round-off errors. An example of when you might encounter truncation errors is when solving integrals (a sequence of summations) on a computer. Given that we mostly work with computers that have finite precision arithematic, we must represent integrals as finite summations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate truncation errors we are going to sum all the integer values from $1$ to $N$, but we are going to represent each integer as a numpy.float32 type. In the cell below, I've writen a function that finds the analyical solution to $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}i$, for a given $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job (write responses in the markdown cell below):\n",
    "* First, create a Numpy array of size $N$ containing numpy.float32 values representing the integers from $1-N$, and have the values stored in consective indexing order (i.e. arr[0] = 1.0, arr[1] = 2.0, ..., arr[N-1] = N.0).\n",
    "* Next, you need to create function that calculates and returns the sum of this array (make it fast, and feel free to use numpy functions). Besure to verify that your sum is the same as the analytical sum. I suggest starting with an array of just 10 elements, so $N=10$.\n",
    "* Once you have verified that your sumation function is returning the correct results, you have two tasks:\n",
    "    1. Find the value of $N_{inc}$ at which your summation is no longer correct. Discuss in the markdown cell below how you found this value. \n",
    "    2. Write an improved summation that can correctly sum all the values to find the answer of $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{2\\cdot N_{inc}}$ (the sum upto $2\\cdot N_{inc}$). Discuss your reasoning about how you chose to solve this task.\n",
    "    3. Special Case: If you are taking this course for 4-units, then write a recursive function recur_sum() that can solve problem 2. All values must remain as numpy.float32 values (no type-casting). Then test your fuction for $4\\cdot N_{inc}$ (it should be accurate without any changes, but if it's not, that's ok).\n",

    "For **question 1**: A simple search is performed by a loop over $N$, until the analytic and Numpy numeric results are different. I find $N_{inc} = 5793$.<br>\n",

    "Note that for function `analytic_sum`, I change the data type to `np.int64` in order to provide accurate results even for very large $N$ (although 64 bits can represent far more significant digits than needed).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inaccuracy arises when the sum has more significant digits than can be represented by the 23 fraction bits in `np.float32`. The upper limit for integer representation is $2^{24} - 1 = 16777215$, while for $N = N_{inc} = 5793$, we have $N(N+1)/2 = 16782321$. Therefore, $N_{inc} = 5793$ is reasonable.\n",

    "For **question 2**: The simple solution is to type-cast the numbers into `np.float64`, which can represent numbers with more significant digits. Theoretically, this trick is valid for $N < N_{inc} \\approx 1.3\\times10^8$."
